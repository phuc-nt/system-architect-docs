# System Architecture Documentation

A collection of system architecture documentation for teaching purposes.

## 📚 Architecture Patterns

### 1. [5-Layer Architecture](./5-layer/)

A layered architecture pattern that separates concerns into 5 distinct layers.

**Main Documents**:
- [5-Layer Architecture Overview](./5-layer/5-layer-architecture.md) - Core concepts and principles
- [Construction Project Management Example](./5-layer/construction-project-management-5-layer.md) - Practical example with diagrams

**Key Benefits**:
- Clear separation of concerns
- Improved maintainability and scalability
- Enhanced reusability and testability
- Independent layer scaling

**Best For**: Large-scale applications, teams > 5 people, long-term maintenance projects
